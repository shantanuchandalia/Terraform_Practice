# Terraform_Practice
This is a basic project which just created a t2.micro machine.

Here, there are two files which are created after execution : terraform.tfstate & terraform.tfstate.backup.
It contains all the information of the machine which is created. 

There are two files here:
instance.tf : configuration parameters of the machine are given in this file.
version.tf: Checks for version of Terraform
